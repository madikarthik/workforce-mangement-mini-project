It is practically impossible to have an ideal workspace where the effort by 
every worker in a company is constant. Not every employee in a company is 
active, there is also a possibility that a company feeds unproductive candidates 
who often disturb the economics of that company and in most cases the 
company is not aware of them. We all know that every individual has ones own 
capacity to handle things, and to evaluate and analyse ones contribution in 
company growth (or sustenance) is the speck ARC/Bell Curve methodology is 
focused on. According to this project, the core significance of using the ARC 
system is to categorize the contributors (irrespective of the quantity of their 
work submissions) into various segments of the Bell Curve which are mostly 
tagged by specific enumeration brackets. The reason why we think this system 
is essential is due to the fact that in India, due to an immense population and 
higher employee strength in companies, there is seemingly no official system 
that is followed by Indian companies as of now to estimate and evaluate the 
work ethics of company workforce. By using this system on employees of 
certain department in a company on their overall performance over a course 
of time helps the Human Resources (HR) department or the payroll
professional to decide the status of employee career in the company. The 
workforce on the extreme parts of the Bell Curve are subjected to firing or 
promotion termed over certain course of time.
